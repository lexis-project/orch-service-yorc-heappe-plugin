The Yorc HEAppE plugin implements a Yorc ([Ystia orchestrator](https://github.com/ystia/yorc/)) plugin as described in [Yorc documentation](https://yorc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html), allowing the orchestrator to use the HEappE (([High-End Application Execution](http://heappe.eu)) API to manage jobs executions on HPC infrastructures.

## TOSCA components

This plugin provides the following TOSCA components defined in the TOSCA file [a4c/ddi-types-a4c.yaml](a4c/heappe-types-a4c.yaml)
that can be uploaded in [Alien4Cloud](https://alien4cloud.github.io/) catalog of TOSCA components:

* enable_file_transfer: Enables files transfer to/from the job
* disable_file_transfer: Disables files transfer to/from the job
* list_changed_files: lists the files created/updated by the job, and their modification date.
The list of files created/updated by the job is provided by this component attribute `changed_files`.

### org.lexis.common.heappe.nodes.JobWithRuntimeTaskParameters
HEAppE job for which the task parameters are not properties configured before the deployment,
but are attributes defined at runtime by another TOSCA component.

### org.lexis.common.heappe.nodes.WaitFileAndGetContentJob
